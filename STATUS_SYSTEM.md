# Traceloop AI Status System

This document describes the automated status validation system for Traceloop AI that ensures all quick start steps are working correctly.

## Overview

The status system provides real-time validation of all quick start steps mentioned in the documentation and website, giving users confidence that the instructions they're following actually work.

## Components

### 1. Status Page (`traceloop-website/status.html`)

A public-facing status page that displays:
- Overall project status
- Individual test results for each quick start step
- Last updated timestamp
- Known issues and their status
- CI/CD integration information

**URL**: [https://traceloop-ai.dev/status.html](https://traceloop-ai.dev/status.html)

### 2. Validation Script (`scripts/validate-quickstart.sh`)

An automated bash script that tests:
- **Server Installation Methods**:
  - Go installation (`go install`)
  - Docker installation (`docker run`)
  - Homebrew installation (`brew install`)
- **Server Functionality**:
  - HTTP server startup
  - gRPC server startup
  - Health check API
  - Traces API
  - Stats API
- **Python SDK**:
  - Installation via pip
  - Import functionality
  - Basic tracing decorators
- **Examples**:
  - Simple test script
  - Python SDK test script
  - Mock LLM calls

### 3. CI/CD Integration (`.github/workflows/validate-quickstart.yml`)

GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Runs on every push to main/develop branches
- Runs daily at 2 AM UTC
- Executes the validation script
- Updates the status page with results
- Commits changes back to the repository

### 4. Status Data (`traceloop-website/status.json`)

JSON file containing:
- Last updated timestamp
- Overall status (working/partial/broken)
- Individual test results
- Error messages and notes
- Working/total test counts

## Usage

### Manual Validation

Run the validation script locally:

```bash
# From project root
bash scripts/validate-quickstart.sh
```

This will:
1. Test all quick start steps
2. Generate a status report
3. Update the status page
4. Display a summary

### CI Integration

The validation runs automatically on:
- Every push to main/develop branches
- Daily at 2 AM UTC
- Pull requests to main branch

### Status Page Updates

The status page is automatically updated with each CI run. The page shows:
- Real-time status of all components
- Last update time
- Detailed error messages
- Progress indicators

## Status Levels

- **🟢 Working**: Component is fully functional
- **🟡 Partial**: Component works but has limitations
- **🔴 Broken**: Component is not working
- **⚪ Unknown**: Component has not been tested

## Current Status

As of the last validation run:

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Go Installation | ✅ Working | `go install` works perfectly |
| Docker Installation | ❌ Broken | Docker daemon not running in test environment |
| Homebrew Installation | ❌ Broken | Homebrew tap repository doesn't exist yet |
| Server Health | ✅ Working | Health endpoint responds correctly |
| Server APIs | ✅ Working | All REST APIs functional |
| Python SDK | ✅ Working | Installation and import work |
| Examples | ✅ Working | All example scripts run successfully |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker Installation Fails**
   - Ensure Docker daemon is running
   - Check if the container image exists
   - Verify port availability

2. **Homebrew Installation Fails**
   - The tap repository needs to be created
   - This is expected until the tap is set up

3. **Server Startup Fails**
   - Check if port 8080 is available
   - Ensure the binary was built correctly
   - Check for BadgerDB lock issues

4. **Python SDK Installation Fails**
   - Use a virtual environment
   - Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
   - Check for dependency conflicts

### Fixing Issues

1. **Update the validation script** to handle new edge cases
2. **Fix the underlying issue** in the codebase
3. **Update documentation** to reflect current state
4. **Add new tests** for additional functionality

## Adding New Tests

To add a new validation test:

1. **Add test function** to `scripts/validate-quickstart.sh`:
   ```bash
   test_new_feature() {
       log_info "Testing new feature..."
       if command -v new_command &> /dev/null; then
           NEW_FEATURE_STATUS="working"
           log_success "New feature works"
       else
           NEW_FEATURE_STATUS="broken"
           NEW_FEATURE_NOTES="New feature not available"
           log_error "New feature failed"
       fi
   }
   ```

2. **Add status variables** at the top of the script:
   ```bash
   NEW_FEATURE_STATUS="unknown"
   NEW_FEATURE_NOTES=""
   ```

3. **Call the test** in the main function:
   ```bash
   test_new_feature
   ```

4. **Add to JSON generation** in `generate_status_report()`:
   ```bash
   "new_feature": {
       "status": "$NEW_FEATURE_STATUS",
       "notes": "$NEW_FEATURE_NOTES"
   }
   ```

5. **Update status page** to display the new test

## Monitoring

The status system provides several monitoring capabilities:

- **Real-time status** via the web page
- **JSON API** for programmatic access
- **CI logs** for detailed debugging
- **Email notifications** on status changes (if configured)

## Best Practices

1. **Keep tests focused** - Each test should validate one specific functionality
2. **Provide clear error messages** - Help users understand what went wrong
3. **Update documentation** - Keep the status page and README current
4. **Test locally first** - Validate changes before pushing to CI
5. **Monitor regularly** - Check the status page for any regressions

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add email notifications for status changes
- [ ] Implement status history tracking
- [ ] Add performance metrics to tests
- [ ] Create status badges for README
- [ ] Add integration with external monitoring tools
- [ ] Implement automatic issue creation for broken tests

This status system ensures that Traceloop AI's quick start documentation remains accurate and reliable, providing users with confidence that the instructions they're following will actually work.
